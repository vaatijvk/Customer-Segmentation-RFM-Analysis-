# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis- 

## üìä Project Overview  

This project focuses on **customer segmentation** and **RFM analysis** to enhance targeted marketing strategies and better understand customer behavior. The analysis aims to classify customers into meaningful segments based on their **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary Value** (RFM), enabling actionable insights for marketing efforts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies  

- **Database**: BigQuery (`turing_data_analytics.rfm` table)  
- **Data Analysis**: SQL  
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, or Looker Studio  
- **Time Period**: 2010-12-01 to 2011-12-01

## üìã Key Metrics  

1. **Recency (R)**  
   - How recently a customer made a transaction (calculated from 2011-12-01).  

2. **Frequency (F)**  
   - How often a customer made transactions in the selected period.  

3. **Monetary Value (M)**  
   - The total value of transactions made by a customer.  

4. **RFM Scores**  
   - Use quartiles (1-4) to assign scores for each metric.  
   - Calculate the combined RFM score:  
     **RFM Score = (R Score x R Weight) + (F Score x F Weight) + (M Score x M Weight)**  

5. **Segmentation**  
   - Group customers into actionable segments, such as:  
     - Best Customers  
     - Loyal Customers  
     - Big Spenders  
     - Lost Customers

## üöÄ How to Use  

### 1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Extract data from `turing_data_analytics.rfm` table using SQL.  
   - Use the provided time range: 2010-12-01 to 2011-12-01.  

### 2. **Calculate RFM Values**  
   - Calculate **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary Value** using SQL.  
   - Use `APPROX_QUANTILES` in BigQuery to calculate quartiles for RFM scores.  

### 3. **Segment Customers**  
   - Assign RFM scores to each customer.  
   - Use scores to segment customers into predefined categories.  

### 4. **Visualization and Dashboard**  
   - Visualize results using Tableau, Power BI, or Looker Studio.  
   - Include key metrics and insights for each customer segment.  

### 5. **Insights and Recommendations**

## üìù Insights and Recommendations  

### Key Findings:  
- **Best Customers**: Highest RFM scores. Prioritize these customers for retention campaigns.  
- **Loyal Customers**: Frequent buyers with consistent purchasing patterns. Reward loyalty through exclusive offers.  
- **Big Spenders**: High monetary value but low frequency or recency. Encourage repeat purchases through personalized promotions.  
- **Lost Customers**: Low RFM scores. Identify reasons for churn and win them back with targeted campaigns.  

### Recommendations:  
- Focus marketing efforts on **Best Customers** and **Loyal Customers** to maximize ROI.  
- Re-engage **Lost Customers** with retention strategies.  
- Use predictive analytics to forecast customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.  


- **SQL Accuracy**: Correct calculations for RFM values, scores, and segments.  
- **Visualization**: Clear and insightful dashboards with well-labeled charts.  
- **Insights**: Actionable recommendations based on RFM results.  
- **Presentation**: Effective communication of findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
